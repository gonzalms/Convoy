Convoy
======

Have you ever found yourself as the last car in a convoy worried that you might fall behind and lose the rest due to some miscommunication or driving error? Have you ever been skiing or snowboarding and found yourself needing to tell your friends that you have just found the best spot but didn't know how to get them to know where exactly it is. The solution to those problems and more are solved with the Convoy App. Convoy eliminates the possibility of losing the people you are traveling or just plain having fun with by joining all participating cell-phone users into a group that allows a gps to pinpoint their locations on a map for all the rest to see. Along side the live feed of where the other members may be, there is also running group chat that is supported by the Convoy app to allow the users to let the others know exactly what is going on when and where.

The applications of this app are endless. Whether it's skiing or hiking, driving or fishing, maybe even going to an amusement park, people are always splitting up to accomplish their goals. This app will just take the pain out of trying to find or remember about rendezvous spot.
